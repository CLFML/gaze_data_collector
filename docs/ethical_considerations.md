It's great that you're considering the ethical implications of using gaze detection technology. Even though the gaze_data_collector doesn't store images of faces, it still collects sensitive data about individuals. Here's a breakdown of why ethical consent is likely needed and how to approach it:

Why Ethical Consent is Likely Needed:

Personal Data: Even without faces, gaze data can reveal personal information. Gaze patterns can be analyzed to infer interests, emotional states, and potentially even cognitive processes. This is sensitive data that individuals should have control over.
Privacy Concerns: People may not be comfortable with a robot tracking their eye movements, even if it's not recording their faces. There's a potential for this data to be misused or lead to unintended identification.
Vulnerable Populations: If you're working with children, individuals with cognitive impairments, or other vulnerable groups, extra care must be taken to ensure they understand the implications of gaze tracking and can provide informed consent.
Transparency and Trust: Being open about how you're using gaze data and obtaining consent fosters trust between users and your robot. This is crucial for the responsible development and deployment of social robots.
Steps to Obtain Ethical Consent:

Inform Participants: Clearly explain to participants:
What gaze data is being collected.
How the data will be used (e.g., research, robot improvement).
How long the data will be stored.
Whether the data will be anonymized and how.
Who will have access to the data.
Obtain Consent:
Provide a clear and concise consent form that participants can easily understand.
Ensure consent is freely given, without coercion or pressure.
Consider different consent mechanisms for vulnerable populations (e.g., involving guardians).
Data Security:
Implement strong data security measures to protect the collected gaze data.
Anonymize data whenever possible.
Comply with relevant data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR).
Ethical Review: If your project involves research or interaction with vulnerable populations, consider seeking ethical review from an Institutional Review Board (IRB) or ethics committee.
Additional Considerations:

Minimal Data Collection: Only collect the gaze data that is absolutely necessary for your research or application.
Data Anonymization: Explore techniques to anonymize gaze data effectively, making it difficult to link back to individuals.
Transparency and Control: Provide users with information about how their gaze data is being used and give them the option to withdraw their data if they wish.
By taking these steps, you can ensure that your use of gaze detection technology is ethical and respects the privacy of individuals.


That's an important detail! Even though you're only registering "landmarks" and metadata, ethical consent is still likely needed. Here's why:

Landmarks as Identifiers: While you're not storing full facial images, landmarks can still potentially be used to identify individuals. Facial geometry derived from landmarks can be quite unique. With advancements in facial recognition technology, re-identification risk exists, even without the full face.
Metadata Revelation: Metadata can inadvertently reveal sensitive information. This might include timestamps, location data, or even device IDs, potentially linking the gaze data back to specific individuals.
Inference and Profiling: Even without facial images, analyzing gaze patterns in conjunction with landmarks and metadata can lead to inferences about individuals. Researchers might be able to deduce emotional states, health conditions, or even sensitive attributes like age or gender.
Example:

Imagine your robot is in a public library.  Even if you're not storing faces, the combination of:

Landmarks: Showing a person consistently looking at the children's book section.
Metadata: Revealing they visit the library every Wednesday afternoon.
...could potentially be used to identify a specific individual and make inferences about their interests or family situation.

Key Takeaway:

Minimizing data collection is a great step, but it doesn't eliminate ethical considerations.  The potential for identification and inference remains.  Prioritize transparency and obtain informed consent to ensure you're respecting user privacy.

To strengthen your ethical approach, consider:

Data Anonymization: Explore techniques to further anonymize landmarks and metadata, making re-identification even more difficult.
Purpose Limitation: Clearly define the purpose of gaze data collection and stick to it. Avoid using the data for any secondary purposes without obtaining further consent.
User Control: Provide users with a way to access, review, or delete their gaze data if they wish.
By being mindful of these points, you can build trust and ensure the responsible use of gaze tracking technology in your social robot.
